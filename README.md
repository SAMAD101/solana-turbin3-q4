# Turbin3 Q4 2024 personal repo

This is my personal repository for the Turbin3 Q4 2024 Builders Program.

## Capstone project program: https://github.com/hivemind-cool/voting-pogram

The capstone project is made by me throughout the cohort. I'm continuing 
to building and expanding the project after the program ended.
